##### DATASET #####

The London Crime Data dataset is a large dataset that contains information on over 13 million crimes that took place in London between 2008 and 2016. 
The dataset is available for download from Kaggle.com.

##### ADDING 2 NEW COLUMNS "subregion" AND "season" ######

SELECT *,
  CASE
    WHEN borough IN ('Camden', 'City of London', 'Islington', 'Kensington and Chelsea', 'Lambeth', 'Southwark', 'Westminster') THEN 'Central'
    WHEN borough IN ('Barking and Dagenham', 'Bexley', 'Greenwich', 'Hackney', 'Havering', 'Lewisham', 'Newham', 'Redbridge', 'Tower Hamlets', 'Waltham Forest') THEN 'East'
    WHEN borough IN ('Barnet', 'Enfield', 'Haringey') THEN 'North'
    WHEN borough IN ('Bromley', 'Croydon', 'Kingston upon Thames', 'Merton', 'Sutton', 'Wandsworth') THEN 'South'
    WHEN borough IN ('Brent', 'Ealing', 'Hammersmith and Fulham', 'Harrow', 'Hillingdon', 'Hounslow', 'Richmond upon Thames') THEN 'West'
    ELSE NULL
  END AS subregion,
  CASE
    WHEN CAST(month AS STRING) IN ('12', '1', '2') THEN 'Winter'
    WHEN CAST(month AS STRING) IN ('3', '4', '5') THEN 'Spring'
    WHEN CAST(month AS STRING) IN ('6', '7', '8') THEN 'Summer'
    WHEN CAST(month AS STRING) IN ('9', '10', '11') THEN 'Autumn'
    ELSE NULL
  END AS season
FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
LIMIT 10;

The objective of this SQL query is to enhance the dataset by adding two new columns: subregion and season. 
The subregion column will categorise London boroughs into five regions (Central, East, North, South, and West), 
and the season column will categorise months into four seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, and Autumn). 
This was achieved this by using the CASE statement to apply conditions and map boroughs to their respective subregions and months to their corresponding seasons.
